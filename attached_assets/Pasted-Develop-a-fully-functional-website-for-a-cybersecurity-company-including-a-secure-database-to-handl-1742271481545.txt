Develop a fully functional website for a cybersecurity company, including a secure database to handle sensitive information such as client details, service requests, and incident reports. The website should have the following features:

Homepage: An attractive, professional homepage introducing the company, its mission, and key services. It should include an overview of the company's cybersecurity offerings, with a call-to-action (CTA) button leading to the services page.

Services Page: Detailed descriptions of the various cybersecurity services offered, such as penetration testing, threat detection, vulnerability assessments, compliance audits, and managed security services.

About Us Page: A section providing information about the company’s history, expertise, certifications, and the team of professionals.

Client Portal: A secure login and registration system for clients, where they can access and manage their services, view reports, submit requests, and track ongoing security incidents. This section must use encryption and secure authentication methods.

Contact Page: A contact form for inquiries and consultations. Additionally, the page should include the company’s physical address, phone number, and email, with an integrated map for location.

Blog Section: A blog for publishing cybersecurity news, best practices, and company updates. This section should be easily editable by the website administrators.

Cybersecurity Resources: A page that provides downloadable resources, including guides, case studies, and white papers related to cybersecurity.

Database Integration: A secure database to store client information, service requests, incident reports, and other critical data. Ensure that data access is restricted and encrypted for privacy. Use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and integrate it with the backend of the website for dynamic content management.

Security Features: Implement essential security measures on the website, including HTTPS encryption, firewalls, and DDoS protection. Use a secure authentication system for login areas and employ two-factor authentication (2FA) for clients accessing sensitive data.

Admin Dashboard: An admin panel that allows the website administrators to manage clients, services, blog posts, incident reports, and database records. It should also include analytics for monitoring the site’s performance and security.

Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure the website is responsive and works seamlessly across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

SEO Optimization: The website should be SEO-friendly with optimized metadata, keywords, and content structure to help it rank well on search engines.

Backup and Recovery System: Implement a backup and recovery system for the website and its database to ensure data integrity and continuity in case of emergencies.
